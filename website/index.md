# Overview

This project builds on top of
[asterix-specs](https://zoranbosnjak.github.io/asterix-specs/) - definition files
and generates **asterix libraries**.

```
asterix-specs -> source code generator -> asterix libs
```

The main part of this project is a
[source code generator](https://github.com/zoranbosnjak/asterix-lib-generator/tree/master/code-generator).
Output of this program is the *asterix library* source code for the target programming
language, for example:

- [python](python.html)
- [haskell](haskell.html)

Other target programming languages can be added, while sharing the same
generic asterix structure.
